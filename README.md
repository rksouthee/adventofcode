# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles created by Eric Wastl.

## Building

I have mostly been developing on Windows using
[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) and [LLVM](https://llvm.org/). The main
driver program, `aoc`, uses Win32 libraries to load the dynamic libraries.

### Third party libraries

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
* [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl)
* [cxxopts](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts)

```sh
cmake -B build -S source
cmake --build build --config debug
```

## Running

Each of the solutions are a dynamic library that is loaded by the driver `aoc`.
For example, to run the solution for day 8 for 2023 we can run

```sh
aoc --year 2023 --day 8
```

this will usually wait for input on `stdin`. Can also pass a file

```sh
aoc --year 2023 --day 8 < ../data/2023/day/8/input.txt
```

or point at the `data` directory, and the program will try and find the correct
input file.

```sh
aoc --year 2023 --day 8 --data-dir ../data
```

The program can also download the input file if it doesn't exist, it requires
passing your session cookie

```sh
aoc --year 2023 --day 8 --data-dir ../data --session <your session token>
```

Some of the solutions have tests, the tests can be run with the following command

```sh
aoc --year 2023 --day 8 --run-rests
```

This will only run the tests, once the tests have finished the program will end.
